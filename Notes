Serialization -> Process of converting object to json string .


Standard industry process is that controller should only deal with DTOs
Controller -> Input DTO , Output -> DTO , Downstream (Service) -> DTO

Service -> Input -> DTO , Output ->  DTO  , Downstream (Repository) -> Entity
Service layer is the layer at which conversion from DTO to entity or entity to dto happens
as conversion can be part of business logic

Client -> Input -> DTO , Output -> DTO , everything is DTO.
Client is called by service layer .

Repository -> Input -> Entity ,Output -> Entity , DB saves entity only.

Previously Controller layer was calling mapper and converting DTO to entity and entity to DTO.
BUT now controller layer will deal with DTOs only and conversion will happen in service layer.
